# Machine Vision system to grade Potatoes
Machine vision system to automatically grade potatoes based on their quality. It takes a segregated photo collection of potatoes of varying degrees of quality, applies feature engineering using computer vision techniques, and then uses a FeedForward Neural Network to train a model for classifying good potatoes from bad ones.

**Steps to run the system:**
1. Install the required libraries.
2. Run the python file.

**Required libraries:**
1. cv2
2. Numpy
3. Scipy
4. Scikit-learn
